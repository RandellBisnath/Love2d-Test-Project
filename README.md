# Love2d-Test-Project
 A project I made to test features and to experiment with libraries.

contains a few semi-related features including enemies, bullets, and transitions from map to map.

to move, press wasd, to shoot use the arrow keys. the only other area in the "game" is north, indicated by tiles.
